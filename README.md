# Websocket Foolery

### Purpose

To play around with websocket connections between an express server and a React web app. Express emits an event telling the React app to fetch an endpoint, retrieving a random person's profile.

### Setup

1. Install Packages: `npm install`
2. Run Express Server (in _server/_): `npm run dev`
3. Run React Client (in _client/_): `npm start`
